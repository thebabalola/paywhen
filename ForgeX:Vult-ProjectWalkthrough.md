# ForgeX: Vult — Complete Project Walkthrough

## What it is

ForgeX is a **yield-native DeFi protocol on Base** that stacks two yield sources into one vault position:

1. **ERC-4626 vault yield** — deposits routed to Aave and Compound for lending interest
2. **Uniswap v4 swap fee yield** — a custom hook (VultHook) intercepts swaps and harvests accrued vault yield, donating it back to LPs

Plus an **AI backend** powered by Claude that analyzes portfolios, recommends strategies, and assesses risk.

## Smart Contracts

3 core contracts deployed on Base Mainnet:

| Contract         | Address                                      | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| VaultFactory     | `0x8374257da04F00ABAf74E13EFE5A17B0f08EC226` | User registration + vault deployment factory |
| VultHook         | `0xe988b6816d94C10377779F08f2ab08925cE96D09` | Uniswap v4 hook for yield harvesting         |
| Base PoolManager | `0x498581Ff718922c3f8e6A2444956aF099B2652b2` | Uniswap v4 reference                         |

### VaultFactory.sol — Entry point for the protocol

- User registration system (username, bio, timestamp)
- Admin management with role-based access
- Creates new `UserVault` instances via `createVault(asset, name, symbol)`
- Stores protocol addresses (Aave, Compound, Uniswap, WETH)
- Chainlink price feed registry for USD valuations

### UserVault.sol — ERC-4626 compliant tokenized vault

- Full deposit/withdraw/mint/redeem with proper share accounting
- **Aave integration** — `deployToAave()` / `withdrawFromAave()` for lending yield
- **Compound integration** — `deployToCompound()` / `withdrawFromCompound()` for cToken yield
- **Chainlink price feeds** — `getTotalValueUSD()`, `getSharePriceUSD()`, `getAssetPriceUSD()`
- Pause/unpause mechanism for emergencies
- Share tokens are ERC-20, enabling composability

### VultHook.sol — Uniswap v4 Hook (the key innovation)

- `afterAddLiquidity()` — moves injected liquidity into ForgeX vaults to earn yield
- `beforeSwap()` — withdraws vault assets if needed to ensure pool has enough liquidity
- `afterSwap()` — compares `totalAssets` vs `totalAssetsAccrued`, harvests the difference if > min threshold, donates yield back to LPs via `poolManager.donate()`

### How the yield stacking works

```
LP adds liquidity → VultHook deposits into ForgeX vault → Vault deploys to Aave/Compound
                                                              ↓
LP gets swap fees ← VultHook donates yield back ← Vault earns lending interest
```

## Frontend

**Stack:** Next.js 14, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, Wagmi 3, Viem 2, Reown AppKit

### Pages

- `/` — Landing page (hero, stats strip, features grid, CTA). Three states: not connected (marketing), connected + not registered (registration form), connected + registered (welcome back)
- `/dashboard` — Stat cards, vault grid, AI insights panel with 3 tabs (Insights, Strategy, Risk)
- `/vaults` — Dedicated vault management with protocol info strip

### Key Components

- **Navbar** — `FORGEX : VULT` wordmark, nav links, `LaunchButton` + `<appkit-button />`
- **LaunchButton** — Connection status dot (red/green glow) + Launch App button (opens modal or routes to dashboard)
- **RegisterForm** — Username + bio form, calls `registerUser()` on-chain
- **CreateVaultModal** — Name, symbol, asset selection → calls `createVault()` factory
- **VaultCard** — Displays vault data, protocol allocations (Aave/Compound breakdown), inline deposit/withdraw with 2-step approve+execute flow
- **AIChat** — Floating chat widget (bottom-left), Claude-powered conversational assistant
- **AIInsights** — Dashboard panel with tabs for AI analysis, strategy advice, risk assessment

### Hooks

- `useVaultFactory` — `useIsRegistered()`, `useUserVaults()`, `useUserInfo()`, `useRegisterUser()`, `useCreateVault()`
- `useUserVault` — `useVaultData()` (multi-read: totalAssets, shares, USD values, protocol balances), `useVaultDeposit()` (approve+deposit), `useVaultWithdraw()`

### Wallet Connection

- Reown AppKit with `createAppKit()` called unconditionally in `Web3Provider.tsx`
- `ssr: true` on WagmiAdapter
- Networks: Base Mainnet + Base Sepolia
- Olive green theme variables on the modal

## AI Backend

**Stack:** Python FastAPI, Anthropic Claude (Sonnet 4), Web3.py

### Endpoints

| Route                      | Method | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/portfolio/{address}` | GET    | Fetch on-chain portfolio via Web3.py                        |
| `/api/strategy`            | POST   | AI yield strategy advice (conservative/balanced/aggressive) |
| `/api/risk`                | POST   | AI risk assessment (score 1-10 + breakdown)                 |
| `/api/chat`                | POST   | Conversational AI assistant with history                    |
| `/api/insights`            | POST   | Dashboard bullet-point insights                             |
| `/api/platform-stats`      | GET    | Platform-wide statistics                                    |

### How it works

1. Frontend calls endpoint with user address
2. Backend fetches on-chain data via Web3.py (vault balances, Aave/Compound deployed amounts, USD values, share prices)
3. Formats data as markdown context
4. Sends to Claude with role-specific system prompt
5. Returns analysis as text

## How Deposits Flow Through the System

When a user deposits WETH into their `UserVault`, those assets sit **idle** in the vault by default. The vault owner then decides where to allocate them:

- **`deployToAave(amount)`** — sends WETH to Aave's lending pool, earns lending interest
- **`deployToCompound(amount)`** — sends WETH to Compound's cToken, earns lending interest
- **Keep idle** — assets stay in the vault, earning nothing

### Where Does VultHook Fit?

VultHook is **not something you "deploy to"** as a user. It works on the **Uniswap v4 pool side**, not the vault side. Here's the flow:

```
USER SIDE:                          UNISWAP SIDE:

User deposits WETH into vault       LP adds liquidity to a Uniswap v4 pool
  ↓                                   ↓
Vault owner deploys to Aave/       VultHook.afterAddLiquidity() fires
Compound for yield                    ↓
  ↓                                 Hook moves pool assets into ForgeX vaults
Vault earns lending interest          ↓
  ↓                                 When someone swaps on the pool:
totalAssetsAccrued > totalAssets      VultHook.afterSwap() detects accrued yield
                                      ↓
                                    Hook harvests yield, donates it back to LPs
```

So VultHook is a **passive automation layer** — it sits between Uniswap v4 pools and ForgeX vaults. LPs who provide liquidity to pools that use VultHook automatically get their idle liquidity routed into yield-generating vaults. No user action needed.

### The "Protocol Deployment UI" Gap

Right now on the frontend:

- **You can:** connect wallet, register, create a vault, deposit WETH, withdraw WETH
- **You cannot** (from the UI): tell the vault to actually send those deposited WETH to Aave or Compound

The smart contract functions `deployToAave()` and `deployToCompound()` exist and work — they just don't have buttons in the frontend yet. So if you deposit 1 WETH into your vault today, it just sits there. You'd need the UI to say: "Allocate 0.5 WETH to Aave, 0.5 WETH to Compound" — that's the missing piece.

### In Short

- **No "deploy to Uniswap" needed** — VultHook handles that automatically at the pool level
- **Deploy to Aave/Compound** — these are the manual protocol allocation choices the vault owner makes, and they need a frontend UI

## What Can Be Added/Improved

### High Priority

1. ~~**Multi-asset support**~~ — **DONE.** USDC, DAI, USDT added alongside WETH in CreateVaultModal. Token addresses in `constants.ts`.
2. ~~**Protocol deployment UI**~~ — **DONE.** VaultCard now has "Allocate" button with Deploy to Aave / Deploy to Compound / Withdraw from Aave / Withdraw from Compound. ABIs + hooks added.
3. ~~**Dashboard user profile**~~ — **DONE.** Profile card at top of dashboard shows username, bio, member-since date fetched via `useUserInfo()`. Registration now inline in dashboard.
4. ~~**Vault analytics page**~~ — **DONE.** `/analytics` page live with per-vault yield % accrued, USD value, protocol allocation bar (Aave/Compound/Idle), share price, and live on-chain data.
5. ~~**AI backend deployment**~~ — **DONE.** Deployed to Render at `https://forgex-14vp.onrender.com`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BACKEND_URL` set in `.env.local` and Vercel env vars.

### Medium Priority

5. **VultHook UI integration** — No frontend for viewing hook activity, yield harvests, or LP positions
6. **Notification system** — Transaction confirmations beyond toasts; on-chain event listeners
7. **Portfolio page** — Aggregate view across all vaults with total USD value, combined yield rate
8. **Vault sharing** — Since shares are ERC-20, add transfer/delegation UI
9. **Mobile responsiveness** — Mobile bottom nav exists but some components could be tighter

### Nice to Have

10. **Dark/Light theme toggle** — AION has it, ForgeX is dark-only
11. **Transaction history** — On-chain event indexing for deposit/withdraw/yield events
12. **Real-time yield tracking** — WebSocket or polling for live vault balance updates
13. **Vault comparison tool** — Compare yields across different vault strategies
14. **Governance/Multisig** — Admin operations currently single-owner; could add timelock/multisig
