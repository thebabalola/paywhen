# ForgeX

A decentralized vault platform enabling users to create multiple ERC-4626 compliant vaults for automated yield generation on Base Mainnet.

## Scenario

A. On-chain Dollar Savings for Africans

Users deposit USDC/USDT

Receive a deposit token (dToken)

Earn yield from low-risk DeFi

Fully transparent reserves on-chain

👉 Think: PiggyVest + Risevest + USDC, but on-chain



## Overview

ForgeX is a comprehensive DeFi platform that allows users to:

- **Create Multiple Vaults**: Each user can create multiple personal ERC-4626 compliant vaults
- **Automated Yield Generation**: Deploy assets to DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap) automatically
- **ERC-4626 Standard**: Industry-standard tokenized vault interface for maximum interoperability
- **Share-Based Ownership**: Transferable ERC-20 vault shares representing ownership
- **Protocol Allocations**: Configure how assets are distributed across different DeFi protocols
